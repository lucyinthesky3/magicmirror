Magic Mirror - Weather and Information Display

The Magic Mirror project is a Python-based application that uses the Tkinter GUI library to create an interactive digital mirror. The application fetches real-time data, such as weather updates, time, date, and other useful information, and displays it in a sleek and modern way on a mirror-like interface.
